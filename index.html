            Hi! My name is John Remeto. I am currently a lab technician for the
            aerospace manufacturer Cascade Gasket. I graduated from Linfield
            College with my bachelors of Science in Chemistry and leverage my
            knowledge in my current role as a Lab Technician to evaluate
            elestomeric materials and provide a resource center
            for any elestomeric questions. I am currently enrolled in UW's
            coding bootcamp and plan on moving into a new role doing
            webdevelopment. Growing up I would attend videogame summer camps at
            Digipen, spending my summer coding games. I would later go on to
            take a few more coding classes in college. These experience pushed
            me to dive into UW's coding bootcamp and make the effort to change
            career paths. In my free time I try and stay active and engaged by
            practicing martial arts. Currently I train in 3 different martial
            arts, Jeet Kun Do, Jui Jistu, and kickboxing. This keeps my mind
            stimulated with fun but physically demanding activities.
