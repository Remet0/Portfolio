            Hi! My name is John Remeto. I am currently a lab technician for the
            aerospace manufacturer Cascade Gasket. I graduated from Linfield
            College with my bachelors of Science in Chemistry and leverage my
            knowledge in my current role as a Lab Technician to evaluate
            elestomeric materials and provide a resource center
            for any elestomeric questions. I am currently enrolled in UW's
            coding bootcamp and plan on moving into a new role doing
            webdevelopment. Growing up I would attend videogame summer camps at
            Digipen, spending my summer coding games. I would later go on to
            take a few more coding classes in college. These experience pushed
            me to dive into UW's coding bootcamp and make the effort to change
            career paths. In my free time I try and stay active and engaged by
            practicing martial arts. Currently I train in 3 different martial
            arts, Jeet Kun Do, Jui Jistu, and kickboxing. This keeps my mind
            stimulated with fun but physically demanding activities.

              <p class="indent"> LTBI completes its mission of briging tacos to the people by offering users with a simple choice: make their own tacos, purchase from a nearby restaurant, or be provided with a combined list from both categories. Depending on which option the user selects, one or two API's are then called to return the desired information to the user.</p>  <br>

              <p class="indent">If the user selects to make their own tacos, the TacoFancy API is called and returns ten random recipes. These recipes can then be favorited and saved for later use using local storage in the browser. The front end of this page was written by Austin Robbins and the back end was written by John Remeto.</p> <br>
                  
              <p class="indent">The user selects to browse local restaurants then the Yelp API is called and the ten nearest restaurants are displayed for the user, as well as some meta information about those restaurants. These restaurants can also be saved for reference later in local storage. Favorites from both categories can be viewed on the same page using the Favorites button in the top right corner of the screen. The front end for this page was written by Nich Secord, while the back end was written by Zach Murphy.</p> <br>
